title: 30 days of super productivity

<div class="intro">
  Throughout November, inspired by [Sebastian
  Marshall](http://sebastianmarshall.com/what-if-you-were-to-commit-to-having-the-most-productive-90-days-of-your-life),
  I decided take on the challenge of having the 30 most productive days of my
  life.

It’s scary as it feels like it’s whatever you come down to. When you give
everything you have, you find yourself in a paradoxical state of weakness. What
if the result of your absolute max is disappointing? After my
  pocket-philosophical observations—I decided to give the challenge a fair go.
  For the challenge, I jotted down the things I wanted to achieve:

* Start practising reguarly on the piano. Inspired by a concert with [Olafur
  Arnalds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kYc55bXJFI)
  [and](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itErRn4T2no) [Nils
  Frahm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkbf1-cVUuY) in Berlin, a good friend
  lend me his piano and volunteered to get me started over some beer. I felt it
  was about time I started something completely outside my comfort zone. Music
  was a great candidate.
*  Get back into running. Since the summer of 2011 I have enjoyed barefoot
   running on and off. In August and September I had excused myself with the
   preperations for and the actual [Informatics
   Olympiad](http://sirupsen.com/my-journey-to-the-international-olympiad-in-informatics/)
   and got out of my running rhytm.
* Waste fewer hours a day. Too many hours are wasted on social media, Skype and
  improper planning. Low hanging fruit.
* Start practising for the 2013 Informatic Olympiads. This was a biggie. I wish
  to get a medal at the 2013’s International Olympiad, and commencing regular
  training a year before is an absolute must to obtain that.
* [750 words](http://750words.com/). I had already started this in October, but
  as this was new to me, I felt it should be added to the list. I wanted to wake
  up 15 minutes earlier, and write about whatever first occured to me. Whether
  it was a noun, adjective or verb, I would just go with it and explore every
  road, memory and reflection from there. Somedays it got philosphical, other
  days spiritual, reflective and often political. It proved easy to find
  something to write about once I had broken the barrier each day of the first
  week.
* Figuring out a scheme. How do I get the most done? Planning the day down to
  the minute? Preparing the next day?

These were the added things out of the ordinary things that include work,
assignments, homework, classes, duties and errands.

## The actual month The actual month didn’t actually feel much out of the
ordinary. I quickly found out that I am already very productive and it proved
difficult to cramb in more things. It’s always been a dogma to myself that I
could always do more, if I just planned better and wasted less time. But I
believe I did hit a well-sought limit with the piano-training. I decided to peel
that off in the first week. Every week, I experimented with a new planning
method: planning the entire week at once, planning only the next day, a
combination of the first two. I tried all these three both at a rough level and
at a down-to-the hour specification level. This proved very rewardable. Other
than that, I reached all my goals: I used my time more efficiently, I solved a
lot of Olympiad tasks, wrote a rant every morning and ran 5K or more every other
day.

## Reflections I learned quite a few things about myself and my approach to my
daily life throughout this month.

* Three things is the fous limit. I reconfirmed for myself that focusing on more
  than three times at once is almost impossible for me. For now, these three
  things are: school, work and the olympiad. I am in a point of my life where my
  mind is active from 7 in the morning to 11 in the night every single day.
  Piano currently does not fit.
* More than one habbit change is definitely possible at a time, although hard.
  I’m a firm believer of changing only little at a time, which generally leads
  to greater consistency. Changing or adding more than one habbit, makes it
  exponentially more difficult. The new habbits in this month were running and
  writing (and piano).
* I am near the limit already. Pushing in more things is dangerous at this
  point. I took on a larger school duty which intensified in December and the
  start of January. This was a mistake and made me neglect “the big three”. My
  old dogma of “just planning better” has been put to a final sleep.
* Find your personal best planning system. I tried a lot of different methods,
  and I found that what works best for me is to make a rough plan on sundays of
  what the week is going to be like on paper, listening to some silent music.
  Then keep on track throughout the week every night before going to bed, by
  making a rough plan for the next day and evaluating that day. That way I am
  always on top of my week; assignments, work, errands and training. This also
  prevents these things from popping up when I am laying in my bed. A month like
  this is a great way to figure out what works best for you.
* It proved very motivational. I have never been able to do so much, in so
  little time. Setting a short-level goal like this, involving your larger goals
  is an amazing way to make progress on all fronts.
* Writing every day is rewarding. Keeping a journal is amazing, and 750 words
  every morning is a great way to do that. The gamification part of the website
  works better than I would admit. Many morning I would prepare for meetings or
  classes if I had something special going on. Just try to write out a
  hypothetical conversation where I play the other part as well. By enforcing it
  on myself every morning, I often was more well-prepared for the day. I stopped
  my spree at 50 days because my December month suddenly got out of hand. I plan
  to get into this habbit ASAP. But one habbit at a time. I’m in no rush.

## Conclusions

I recommend everyone taking up a month like this. It’s scary, but very
rewarding. You will raise your understanding of your own task-handling
capabilities and limits, given the right frame of planning.
